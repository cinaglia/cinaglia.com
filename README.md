This is the source-code of my (very simple) personal website, http://cinaglia.com.

The site layout was built on top of [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) in order to leverage its awesome responsive boilerplate. [Grunt](/gruntjs/grunt) was used to handle CSS minification, as well as deployment through rsync.
