# cinaglia.com

This is the V2 version of my [personal website](https://cinaglia.com). It is almost identical to the [previous version](https://github.com/cinaglia/cinaglia.com), the difference being
that this was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Building the website locally
TODO

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`
