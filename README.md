This is the V2 version of my [personal website](https://cinaglia.com). It is almost identical to the [previous version](https://github.com/cinaglia/cinaglia.com/tree/V1), the difference being that this was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Quick start

1. Install the Gatsby CLI globally.

```sh
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

2. Install the project's dependencies.

```sh
yarn install
```

3. Run the app in development.

```sh
gatsby develop
```

4. Start coding! The site should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.
